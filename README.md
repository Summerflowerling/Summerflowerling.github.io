# My Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio and art gallery â€” a place where I showcase both my watercolor paintings and my frontend engineering work. Think of it as a mix of creative expression and technical playground.

## My Design Process

I didnâ€™t just throw code together â€” I wanted the site to feel like _me_. Hereâ€™s how I approached it:

1. **Inspiration Hunt**: Started with Pinterest for layout ideas and color palettes that felt right.
2. **Trend Check**: Googled 2025 web design trends and explored a bunch of aesthetic websites. Glassmorphism and scroll-triggered animations instantly caught my attention â€” clean, modern, and fun to implement.
3. **Build + Refine**: Picked the elements I liked and made them work together, always balancing looks with usability.
4. **Dark Mode**: I also added dark mode â€” because sometimes our eyes deserve a coffee break too.

## Whatâ€™s Next

This project is still evolving. Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m planning:

- Add micro-animations when navigating between sections (instead of just scrolling).
- Write unit tests (because good design also deserves reliable code).
