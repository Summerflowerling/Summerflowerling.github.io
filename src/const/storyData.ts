That path took me deeper into engineering, where I crafted React Native tools that boosted user engagement and whipped up quick prototypes alongside international teams. These days, I'm using React and TypeScript to create AI-powered tools that foster warm, human-like patient interactions, boosting retention through thoughtful, personalised experiences. Fluent in English, Mandarin, and conversational Japanese, with helpline volunteer work sharpening my empathy and problem-solving skills, I thrive on the human side of tech, like listening to needs and coding solutions that stick.",
