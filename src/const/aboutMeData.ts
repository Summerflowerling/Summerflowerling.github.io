    review:
      'Echo (Sanmao) is a hugely influential writer in the Chinese-speaking world. If she were still alive, she’d be in her 80s now. Back in an era when travel wasn’t common, she was already bold enough to settle in the Sahara Desert. This book is a collection of stories about her adventures with her Spanish husband in the remote desert, filled with lively and fascinating accounts of their daily interactions with the locals. I reread it every year, and it never fails to captivate me.',

      'This gripping thriller is part of my favourite mystery series by my top suspense writer. I’ve always loved crime and mystery novels, and in a way, being a developer feels a bit like being a detective—piecing together clues when debugging to get to the heart of a problem.',

    review:
      'As a dog lover, I adored *Man Meets Dog* by Konrad Lorenz. This charming blend of science and heartfelt stories about dogs captures their quirks and the human-canine bond. Though some ideas are dated, the fascinating insights, vivid anecdotes, and cute sketches make it a page-turner. A must-read for pet enthusiasts!',
